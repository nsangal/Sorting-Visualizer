# Sorting-Visualizer: Bubble Sort with Sound
This project is a visualization tool for understanding the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Demo
Visit https://sortingvisualizernsangal.netlify.app to interact with the visualization.



## Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Features

- Generates a random array of 40 elements and sorts them using Bubble Sort.
- Visualizes the sorting process step by step.
- Generates sound effects corresponding to the sorting actions.

## How to Use

1. Open the https://sortingvisualizernsangal.netlify.app
2. Click the "Start" button to start the visualization.
3. Watch as the elements move into their sorted positions.
4. Listen to the sound effects accompanying each sorting action.
